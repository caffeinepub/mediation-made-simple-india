# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a subtle “Created by Gauri Jadhav” credit to the global site footer without altering the existing caffeine.ai credit/link.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the global footer to display the exact text “Created by Gauri Jadhav” alongside the existing “Built with … using caffeine.ai” credit.
- Style the new creator credit with a muted/secondary, visually subtle treatment consistent with existing footer text.
- Ensure the footer layout remains responsive on mobile and desktop (no overflow; readable spacing/alignment) while keeping the existing caffeine.ai link and URL/tracking parameters unchanged.

**User-visible outcome:** On all pages, users see a subtle “Created by Gauri Jadhav” footer credit next to the existing caffeine.ai credit, with the caffeine.ai link still present and functional.
